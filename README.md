# Web-project
This website is a prototype for an e-health platform called MESMTF, designed to manage patient and healthcare provider interactions, with a focus on diseases like Malaria and Typhoid Fever. The entire system operates client-side, using the browser's localStorage to simulate a database for users, medical records, appointments, and pharmacy data.
